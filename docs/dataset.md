# Dataset 

The purpose of this dataset is the learn action effects in scenes with rich interactions between a deformable bag and multiple rigid objects.

This dataset contains 20 different tasks for four actions:
* Pushing an object towards the bag
* Handle motion along a circular trajectory
* Opening the bag
* Lifting the bag

## Tasks

The following parameters differentiate the tasks:
* Bag Stiffness: Is the bag's material stiff or soft?
* Bag Content: Is the bag empty or is a rigid object inside?
* Left/Right Handle State: Is the handle fixed in place, released or moved along a trajectory?
* Controlled Object: Which object is actively manipulated during the action?
* Action: Which action is executed?
